Dataset from: https://github.com/evagian/Myopia-study-classification-logistic-regression-R/tree/master/dataset

The python file reads the dataset and creates the .owl ontology.

The dataset is a subset of data from the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM), a cohort study of ocular component development and risk factors for the onset of myopia in children. Data collection began in the 1989–1990 school year and continued annually through the 2000–2001 school year. All data about the parts that make up the eye (the ocular components) were collected during an examination during the school day. Data on family history and visual activities were collected yearly in a survey completed by a parent or guardian.

The dataset used in this text is from 618 of the subjects who had at least five years of follow-up and were not myopic when they entered the study. All data are from their initial exam and the dataset includes 17 variables. In addition to the ocular data there is information on age at entry, year of entry, family history of myopia and hours of various visual activities. The ocular data come from a subject’s right eye.

Based on the given features classify each record whether the child with by myopic in the next five years or not.
